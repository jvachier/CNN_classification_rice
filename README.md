My goal is to use convolutional neural networks (cnn) to identify and classify 5 kinds of rice Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine and Karacadag. The data set used here can be found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muratkokludataset/rice-image-dataset/). For each kind of rice, each folder contains 15 000 pictures. The total number of pictures is 75 000. The following analysis is organized as follows. Firstly, I import and pre-process the pictures by renaming them. Secondly, I create three folders 'test', 'train' and 'valid' with the picture randomly chosen. Thirdly, I built a CNN model to identify the 5 different prices provided in the data set. Finally, I train and test the CNN model and visualize the results by plotting the confusion matrix.
